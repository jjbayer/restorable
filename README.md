# reStorable

PDF rendering tool for the [reMarkable paper tablet](https://remarkable.com/).

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress, not in any way affiliated with reMarkable AS. The PDF output will not be as sophisticated as the one generated by reMarkable's own software.

## Getting Started

First, set the path to the xochitl data directory:

    $ restorable set-dir /path/to/xochitl

This corresponds to ``/home/root/.local/share/remarkable/xochitl`` on the reMarkable device. You can, for example, mount it using [SSHFS](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs).

## Usage

### List your documents

    $ restorable tree
    - Quick Sheets
    - Work
      - Archive
        - 2020
          - Notes
      - Meeting minutes
    - Private
      - Travel Journal

### Save a notebook as PDF

    $ restorable render-notebook "Work/Meeting Minutes" meeting-minutes.pdf

### Render all notebooks

    $ restorable render-all /path/to/pdf_directory


## Credit

Credit goes to the [reMarkable Wiki](https://remarkablewiki.com/) and especially to [ax3l](https://github.com/ax3l), who wrote a [blog post](https://plasma.ninja/blog/devices/remarkable/binary/format/2017/12/26/reMarkable-lines-file-format.html) without which I would not have figured out reMarkable's line file format.

## TODO

- Write metadata to PDF
- Use different brush templates for different pens (e.g. pencil)
- Use pressure and rotation to determine line width
